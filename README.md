# Reed-Scanner
A measuring device for woodwind reeds to determine their properties in various ways.
This data will be processed to evaluate what makes a reed play well.

<h1>What does the device measure?</h1>
The Reed Scanner measures various thicknesses using a laser TOF sensor. The weight of the reed is determined using a load cell, and the vibrational properties of the reed are determined with a piezoelectric disc to measure induced vibrations from a vibration motor probe.
